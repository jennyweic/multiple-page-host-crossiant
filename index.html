    <p>
      Culinary experts agree that the prototype of the modern-day croissant is
      the “kipferl”, which first appeared in Austria in the 13th century.
      Kipferl are small, curved, sweet pastries mostly made from yeast dough.
      They taste more like bread rolls and due to the lack of lamination (the
      process of folding and rolling butter into dough over and over again to
      create super-thin layers), don’t possess the characteristic flaky texture
      of croissants that is so loved today. Popular legend credits the French
      Queen and Austrian native, Marie Antoinette (1755-1793) with introducing
      the kipferl, and thus the croissant, to France.
